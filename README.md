# KaggleTitanic
The models for this project were built and tested using Weka.
How to use:
1. Download "titleread.csv" and "testread.csv," two edited versions of the training and test data that have no headers, spaces replaced with underscores, and missing values replaced with ?'s.
2. Compile and run titleregex.java to convert these datasets into .arff format.
3. Use the resulting train.arff and test.arff files in Weka.
